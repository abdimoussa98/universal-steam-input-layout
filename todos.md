Spike:
Figure out a way to add "L1&R1: Tap Cover" whilst in Modifier 2 layers without using always on action. Since i want to be able to remove RST/LST layer and add the tap cover on RST/LST release. Currently if i do this, the always on action will be interrupted and crash steam.

- [x] In "Modifier 2" layers
    - [x] On RST/LST release, remove RST/LST layers & add "L1&R1: Tap Cover"
