# Todo:
universal-layout-alternative:
    We need to swap all functionality on the bumpers and the triggers.

    Recipe:
        Have the alternative layout open to the triggers
        Have the DUELSENSE example layout open to the triggers
        Have the default layout open to the bumpers

        Use the structure from the example layout
        Use the values from the default layout
        Update the alternative
        
        Swap the recipe for the bumpers now
