# Todo:

- [ ] Make L1&R1: Tap Cover interruptable (in R1!L1, L1!R1, R2!L2, and L2!R2 layers)
- [ ] Handle gyro layers for triggers
- [ ] Handle steering layer
- [ ] Handle cursor gyro layer
- [ ] Repurpose chorded ramp up layers to chorded ramp up gyro layers; add gyro off layer when ramping up without holding triggers (by default ramp up layers just inherit gyro settings)
