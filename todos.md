# Todo:

- [x] Make L1&R1: Tap Cover interruptable (in R1!L1, L1!R1, R2!L2, and L2!R2 layers)
- [ ] Handle gyro layers for triggers
- [ ] Repurpose chorded ramp up layers to chorded ramp up gyro layers; add gyro off layer when ramping up without holding triggers (by default ramp up layers just inherit gyro settings)
- [ ] Make base gyro activation dependent on: left stick deflect, right stick deflect, left stick touch, right stick touch, Select, and Start all being held at the same time. This removes the need for mode shifts everywhere we want to hold Start and Select (L1/R1 layers and Menu button layers)
- [ ] Handle steering layer
- [ ] Handle cursor gyro layer
